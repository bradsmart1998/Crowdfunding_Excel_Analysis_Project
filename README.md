## Introduction

For this project I have completed some analysis using data containing information on crowdfunding campaigns. The analysis on this project has all been completed on microsoft excel where I have showcased my skills in utiising formulas, functions and pivot tables to obtain actionable insights on crowdfunding campaigns. Using this analysis, I have been able to draw data driven conclusions around crowdfunding campaigns 

## The Data

The Data for this project had information on 1000 crownfunding campaigns, information on how much was raised and whether they were successful or not. These crowdfunding campaigns have been split into categories and sub-categories which I will use to analyse the data. I have used conditional formating to highlight successful and failed crowdfunding campaigns and worked out the averaged donationation.
